# swim-ui ↔ ngx-ui Design Parity

Components in `@swimlane/swim-ui` must match the Angular `@swimlane/ngx-ui` design and behavior. Use ngx-ui as the single source of truth.

## Design system

- **Colors**: Use tokens from `src/styles/tokens/colors.ts` (aligned with ngx-ui). Use CSS variables (e.g. `--blue-500`, `--grey-050`) in component styles; do not hardcode hex/rgb in components.
- **Typography**: Use `typography.ts` tokens for font size, weight, line height so they match ngx-ui.
- **Spacing**: Use `spacing.ts` and base CSS variables for padding, margin, border-radius.
- **Transitions**: Use consistent timing (e.g. 200ms for background/shadow, 250ms for opacity/underline) to match ngx-ui motion.

## Behavior parity

- Implement the same **variants**, **sizes**, and **states** as the corresponding ngx-ui component (e.g. primary/warning/danger, sm/md/lg, disabled/loading).
- Match **keyboard and focus** behavior and **ARIA** usage so accessibility aligns with ngx-ui.
- When ngx-ui has special behavior (e.g. promise-based button state, floating labels, validation), replicate the same semantics and UX in the Lit component.

## Reference

- Compare with the Angular component under `projects/swimlane/ngx-ui` (or equivalent) for props, CSS classes, and behavior.
- Keep parity for: visual states, hover/focus/active, disabled, error/success, and any icons or slots.
