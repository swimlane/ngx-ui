# ngx-ui

> **The ngx-ui library README can be found [here](/projects/swimlane/ngx-ui).** This README is for the ngx-ui demo.

## Building ngx-ui

- Use `npm run build-pkg` to build ngx-ui. This must be done prior to building the demo.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` to serve the demo at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
