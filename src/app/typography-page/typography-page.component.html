    As cyber attacks continue to rise, organizations are investing heavily in attack identification, threat intelligence
    and the staff required to protect the enterprise. However, alerts are still going unresolved, and often unseen.
    Realizing that simply adding people does not solve the problem, organizations are choosing Swimlane for security
    automation and orchestration
  </p>
  <p>
    Swimlane consolidates security alerts from multiple sources and automatically assists organizations with the
    activities required to resolve alerts and stop attacks. The resolution of the alert can occur either automatically
    or manually by analyst intervention. Either way, the alert is resolved utilizing expert-defined processes, enabling
    the organization to cost-effectively close alerts.
